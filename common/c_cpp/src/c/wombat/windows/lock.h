 * first thread checks the lexerlockInitialized through atomic action and then
 * starts to initialize the mutex which isn't atomic. The second thread checks
 * the variable lexerlockInitialized it has been incremented, this thread would
 * then try to grab a lock that is not initialized. On windows this causes the
 * application to hang therefore after the mutex is initialized the variable
 * xxxUseLock is set to 1. Just before a lock is acquired it will poll until
 * xxxUseLock is not equal to zero this will stop the race condition. A
 * condition variable can't be used because you get into the same problem of
 * waiting for an uninitialized condition variable
