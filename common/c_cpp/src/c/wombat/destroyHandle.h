/* The destroy handle is used where there are multiple threads using a single
 * resource which is needed until all threads have ended. The problem with this
 * scenario is knowing when to destroy the object. If the owner thread deletes
 * the object then other threads may in-advertantly access it despite the memory
 * being freed.
 * A destroy handle contains a reference to the object and a count of the number
 * of outstanding threads. The destroy handle will only be destroyed once the object
 * itself has been destroyed and all threads have finished using it. This means that
 * although the object may be gone the thread will have valid memory to access.
