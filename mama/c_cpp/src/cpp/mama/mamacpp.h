/**
 * \mainpage Middleware Agnostic Messaging API (MAMA) C++ API
 *
 * Middleware Agnostic Messaging API.
 * The Middleware Agnostic Messaging (MAMA) API provides an
 * abstraction layer over various messaging middleware platforms.  In
 * particular, MAMA adds market data semantics to messaging platforms
 * that would otherwise be too limited for use as a market data
 * distribution middleware.  Features that MAMA adds to any messaging
 * middleware are:
 * - Subscription management (initial values, throttling).
 * - Entitlements/permissioning.
 * - Data quality.
 *
 * The goal of MAMA is to maximize application portability.  Once an
 * application has been ported to MAMA, it should never have to be
 * ported to another market data messaging API again.  Many firms have
 * invested time in building and maintaining their own abstraction
 * APIs - and they should be commended for that.  Wombat hopes that
 * even those firms will see the benefit in migrating to MAMA and
 * thereby reducing costs further and, as more third party firms
 * migrate applications to MAMA (and MAMDA, see below), benefit even
 * more from this compatibility.
 *
 *
 * A higher level market data API is also available: the Middleware
 * Agnostic Market Data API (MAMDA).  While MAMA provides a
 * field-based abstraction to market data, MAMDA provides smart,
 * specialized data types to deal with specific market data events,
 * such as trades, quotes, order books, etc.  MAMDA is particularly
 * suitable for applications such as program trading and tick capture
 * systems, where context is important.  MAMA is more suited to
 * applications that don't care about the meaning of fields, such as a
 * simple, field-based market data display application.
